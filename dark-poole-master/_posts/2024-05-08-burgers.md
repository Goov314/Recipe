## Intro

Whether you are having an outdoor barbeque, or just want some comfort food, this burger patty recipe is for you! This recipe is a modified version of [This Recipe](https://www.food.com/recipe/the-perfect-burger-92021), from Food.com.

## Ingredients

* 1 Egg
* 1TSP of Dijon Mustard
* 1TSP of Worcestershire Sauce
* 1 Small Onion, Finely Grated
* 1 Minced Clove of Garlic
* <sup>1/2</sup>TSP of Salt
* <sup>1/2</sup>TSP of Pepper
* 1lb of Ground Beef
* <sup>1/4</sup>Cup of Panko

## Directions

1. Lightly oil the grill and heat the barbeque to medium.

2. Whisk the egg in a bowl, then add all of the Spices, Sauces and Vegetables. It is at this step where you can add any other flavour you may desire to your burger. 

3. Crumble in the Ground Beef and add the Panko and gently mix. Try not to overwork the meat, the more you mix, the tougher it gets.

4. Gently shape the mixture into burgers that are about <sup>3/4</sup> of an inch thick. Create a shallow depression in the center of each burger to prevent it from puffing up while on the grill.

5. Place burgers on the grill and close the lid. Cook until <strong>NO LONGER PINK INSIDE</strong>, turning once, cooking around 6-8 minutes per side. Burgers should have a temperture of at least 160F. Don't poke them too much while they are on the grill or they may lose some of their juices.

6. Place on a bun and add any toppings you desire. Enjoy!
